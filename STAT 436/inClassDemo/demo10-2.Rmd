[Single-Cell Genomics]  In this problem, we will apply UMAP to a
[dataset](https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/ai539s30rjsw5ke4vxbjrxjaiihq7edk.csv)
of Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC) released by 10X Genomics. The first
column, `cell_tag`, gives an identifier for each cell in the dataset. All other
columns are molecules that were detected in that cell. For example, CD74 is a
molecule often found on the surface of T-cells.
    
a. Define a tidymodels `recipe` that specifies that UMAP should be performed
with the parameters `learn_rate = 0.1` and `neighbors = 5`. There is no need to
normalize these data, as they have been normalized in advance using methods
tailored to single-cell genomics data.

```{r}
pbmc <- read.csv("https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/ai539s30rjsw5ke4vxbjrxjaiihq7edk.csv")

head(pbmc)
```

```{r}
umap_rec <- recipe(~ ., data = pbmc) %>%
  update_role(cell_tag, new_role = "id") %>%
  step_umap(all_predictors(),learn_rate = 0.1, neighbors = 5)

umap_prep <- prep(umap_rec)
```

b. Compute the UMAP embeddings across cells. Color points in by their value of
the GNLY molecule.

```{r}
embeddings <- bake(umap_prep, new_data = pbmc) %>%
  left_join(pbmc)
embeddings

ggplot(embeddings) +
  geom_point(aes(UMAP1,UMAP2,col=GNLY), size = 0.3, alpha = 0.4) +
  scale_color_viridis_c()
```
