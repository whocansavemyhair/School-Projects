## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(penguins) +
  geom_point(aes(bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm, col = species, shape=islands), size = 3) + 
  scale_shape()
  labs(x = "Bill Lenth(mm)", y = "Bill Depth(mm)", col = "Species", shape = "Island")
```

The data below measures properties of various Antarctic penguins.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
theme_set(theme_bw())
penguins <- read_csv("https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/ijh7iipc9ect1jf0z8qa2n3j7dgem1gh.csv")
```
Create a single plot that makes it easy to answer both of these questions, (i)
How is bill length related to bill depth within and across species? (ii) On
which islands are which species found?
